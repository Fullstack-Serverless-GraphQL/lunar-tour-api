# Lunar Tour API 🌟

Welcome to the Lunar Tour API that is part of [Fullstack Serverless GraphQL](https://fullstack-serverless-graphql.netlify.com/), which teaches you how to build Serverless GraphQL APIs. This API allows users to make bookings to lunar destinations, as well as view lunar holiday activies.

The stack for this API is as follows:

🌟 [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

🌟 [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

🌟 [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/)

🌟 [Apollo Lambda Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)

What you need to use this Repo:

🧁 An AWS Account

🧁 Serverless Framework

🧁 NodeJS v12.x or above

## Installation steps

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fullstack-Serverless-GraphQL/lunar-tour-api
```

Then cd into the directory of the project:

```bash
cd lunar-tour-api
```

Once you're in then install the packages using your fav package manager:

Now you can open playground on `localhost://4000` :

You should be able to run queries and mutations against the API locally now.
