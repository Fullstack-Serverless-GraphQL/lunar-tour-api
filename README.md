# Lunar Tour API 🌟

Welcome to the Lunar Tour API that is part of Fullstack Serverless GraphQL, which teaches you how to build Serverless GraphQL APIs. This API allows users to make bookings to lunar destinations, as well as view lunar holiday activies.

The stack for this API is as follows:

🌟 [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

🌟 [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

🌟 [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/)

🌟 [Apollo Lambda Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)

What you need to use this Repo:

🧁 An AWS Account

🧁 Serverless Framework

🧁 NodeJS v12.x or above
